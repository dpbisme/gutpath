This dataset contains over 180,000 cells belonging to at least 49 unique cell types or states isolated from the messenteric lymph node (MLN) that drains the distal small intestine.  All cells were derived from C57BL6 mice obtained from the same commercial provider (Jackson Laboratories) and the same breeding room.  See our **[FAQ]()** page for more details on the study and methods used.
